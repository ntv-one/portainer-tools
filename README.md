# Portainer Tools: Merge and Host App Template definitions
---

This application is a fork of [https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools](https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools) for the purpose of testing, development, and possible extension. It would not be useful outside of my specific use-case, if this sounds like something you could use, I encourage you to visit the original repository, or see the related post at [Technorabilia](https://www.technorabilia.com/portainer-tools-merge-and-host-app-template-definitions/).
